Lecture summary after taking CMU DB Lecture(by Youtube)

***
I decided to go to lab and study more when I graduate university.
In other words, I'll go to gratudate school. So, I think I should study to prepare it.

Now I'm taking CMU DB Lecture by Andy Pavlo, and I want to save records of my study.
This repository is for that purpose.
